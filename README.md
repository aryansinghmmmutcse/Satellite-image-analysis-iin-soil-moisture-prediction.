It is essential to comprehend how the environment and climate vary. The geophysical data of NASA under the mission of soil moisture active passive (SMAP) have shown to be a valuable resource, offering hitherto undiscovered insights into the dynamics of soil moisture, and associated geophysical terms like sunshine, humidity, saturation of land, temperature of the surface, and vegetation, etc. To evaluate the effect of global warming on climatic changes, analysis of the SMAP has been conducted in several regions of Gujarat, India, over the last four years (2020-2023) in the current study. After preprocessing the original dataset for missing value imputation, significant features with a greater influence on the surface soil moisture were extracted using a random forest technique. Lastly, a model for predicting soil moisture was constructed utilizing the chosen characteristics and the gradient boosting (GB) technique.
